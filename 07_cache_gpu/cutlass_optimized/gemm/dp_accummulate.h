/**
 * \brief Abstraction for exposing architecture-specific "dot-product-accumulate"
 * ISA operations
 *
 * Given two K-component vectors a and b having type value_t[K] and an addend c
 * of type accum_t, the "dot-product-accumulate" of type accum_t is computed
 * as d = x[0]*y[0] + x[1]*y[1] + ...  + x[K-1]*y[K-1] + c.
 *
 * We use the notation "dpK" to connote a K-component dot-product-accumulate.
 * For example, "dp1" is a simple multiply-add.
 *
 * For given pairing of value_t and accum_t types, the corresponding
 * dp_accummulate class will:
 *
 * - Define the member-type dp_vector_t as the appropriate K-component vector
 *   type needed to leverage architecture-specific "dot-product accumulate"
 *   ISA operations.
 * - Implement the corresponding dot-product operation between two dp_vector_t
 *   inputs a and b.
 *
